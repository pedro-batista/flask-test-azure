# Remix Python experiment

This is an experiment, to try and get a Python web app running, with web.py

The original code was "remixed" from this other Hyperdev solution:
- https://hyperdev.com/#!/project/frost-kicker

Original README:
- requirements.txt holds your dependencies, they are installed with pip
- There is no automatic reinstallation yet: you have to make changes to
  package.json to force an install (I added a field to do so, just add something there and you'll force a reinstall!)
- If you only need to edit the source code, then it's ok! Just edit it 
  and it will work
